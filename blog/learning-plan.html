      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">Initially I would like to work as a junior web dev, ideally for someone or someplace that aligns with my values and interests, where I can actively grow within the job and gain enough experience to work as an intermediate developer. If it’s do-able to balance intermediate web-dev work with other commitments, then I would consider aiming for more senior positions. I’m still new in this industry and therefore keen to soak up as much information as possible while at DEV so I can land a good  job where I can learn even more. Long term, I would like to be able to apply my skills to projects that prioritise a social and creative impact and I would love to work on these with people who share similar values.</li>
      <br>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">In bootcamp, I think my attitude and social skills will be a strength for pair programming and group work, but my tendency to get lost in details may not be the most productive quality.</li>
      <br>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">Working in a team will be an interesting non-technical challenge. Most of my collaborative projects have been in duos, or in a way where I'm facilitating or hosting a group for some kind of class. I’m really keen to see what it takes to make a team project work well for everyone involved.</li>
      <br>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">I would really like to develop my ability to work effectively in teams, how the different components work and how they can work in a symbiotic way with other components to serve the larger project. I’d love to learn more techniques around constructive feedback and open communication. And I’m also really curious to learn different approaches to leadership and project management.</li>
      <br>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">Clear communication about the course, clarity of process in terms of what to do if you are struggling or running behind on the course work, and just generally checking in on our progress and treating us like human beings.</li>
      <br>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-3">I expect to try my best. I expect that I will find some things really difficult but will acknowledge that these moments are helping me learn. I expect to keep trying. Even when things seem bleak. If I am struggling in any way, with the tech stuff, or the core stuff, I will raise these thoughts with my bootcamp facilitators so that we can think of the best way to handle whatever might be happening. This could include the workload, aspects of social safety or mental health, etc.  <br><br> In the middle and at the end of each sprint I take some time to evaluate how I'm doing.  I also want to spend time during the course prepping for junior web dev job applications in whatever shape or form that takes, I’m still a bit unsure. Just going to gauge it as I go and learn more about the particular career paths of those around me at DEV (facilitators, students and industry reps alike).

<!-- Foundations Learning Plan -->
<div class="border-1"> 
  <h3 class="learning-plan-font">Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
      <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h3></ul>
          <li class="li-blog-3">First I would like to find work as a junior web dev somewhere, 
            ideally a place that aligns with my values and interests, where I can actively grow 
            within the job and gain enough experience to work as an intermediate developer, to 
            see what that level of commitment is like. If it’s do-able to balance intermediate web-dev 
            work, with life and art commitments , then I would maybe aim for senior positions. But these 
            nuances (work-load, skill-level and flexibility) are unknown unknowns and hard to gauge at this point. 
            I’m definitely a newby in this industry and therefore very keen to soak up as much as possible 
            while at DEV so I can land a job where I can learn even more. 
            <br> <br> Generally speaking long term, 
            I would like to apply my skills to creating socially-impactful projects with others who share similar 
            values, and in a way that’s financially sustainable and where I have the option to work remotely. 
          </li>
          <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h3> </ul>
          <li class="li-blog-3"> I mentioned this in my <a href="identity-values-strengths.html">identity, strengths and values</a> blog post in more detail, but I think overall I am an active and engaged learner. 
            I always try to approach new challenges with an open-mind, curiosity, patience and determination. 
            <br> And I’m a creative problem solver (both a strength and a weakness, depending on the situation). 
            My limitations are that I can get really caught up in the details, 
            a bit obsessive over tiny potentially insignificant things 
            (was reminded of this in the first CSS/html attempt for my blog...). 
            So I do my best to ensure I take breaks, and check-in regularly with what the learning expectations are. 
            This helps me to see if i’m spending my energy on trivial stuff. 
            I can also get frustrated when I don’t understand something quickly enough when other people seem to be getting it quickly. 
            That's something I can easily beat myself up about. 
            </li>
            <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
            </h3> 
            </ul>
                <li class="li-blog-2">
                  I would like to get better at working in a team. Most of my collaborative projects have 
                  been in duos, or in a way where I'm facilitating or hosting a group for 
                  some kind of class or event. In saying that, some previous work 
                  environments have been team based but in a loose way where people 
                  are very much focused on their individual roles and only converge 
                  when it’s required. But I'm curious what it would be like in this 
                  line of work, where it seems like you’re really building and 
                  testing something from back to front, and what kind of strategies 
                  people use to work effectively and enjoyably in a team like that 
                  fascinates me. <br> <br> 
                  I would like to get better at acknowledging when I need help. I get a bit stoic and 
                  sometimes a wee bit defeatist when I find something too difficult, so it will be good for me to regularly practise asking for help and clarification.
                </li>
                <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3"> 4.   A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                <br> <br> a.) An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives:</h3></ul>
              <li class="li-blog-3">
                I am committed to trying my best at all the required course work. This includes 
                the technical aspects, but also the core curriculum and the group work and 
                check-ins with facilitators throughout the course. I will do my best to 
                communicate my needs and struggles as I go, and help those around me where I can. 
              </li>

          <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">
                    b.) What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
                  </h3></ul>

                  <li class="li-blog-3">
                    In foundation, I will communicate with my home-group facilitators Jared or 
                    Johnny if things are building up too much. This could include the workload, 
                    aspects of social safety or my own mental health limitations. <br> 
                    I also practise taking time in the middle 
                    and at the end of each sprint to check-in with how I'm feeling, 
                    energy wise, work-load wise, emotionally, mental health etc. <br> So as long as I 
                    stay on top of that, continue my current self-care strategies, it should be manageable. 
                  </li>

              <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">
                    5.   A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:  
                  </h3></ul>
             <li class="li-blog-3">
              In relation to the course content, I will follow the standard process. 
              Try to do something myself, if that doesn’t work, do my own research, 
              if i’m still stuck, reach out to fellow students in the tech/questions section on discord, 
              and if that doesn’t work, reach out to my home-group facilitators.  
              I'm not totally sure what the procedure is during bootcamp, but I will update 
              this as I get a feel for the situation. 
              </li>

              <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">
                6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:  
              </h3></ul>
         <li class="li-blog-3">
          Clear communication about the course, what to do if you are struggling 
          or running behind on the course work, and just generally checking in and 
          treating us like humans with a variety of backgrounds and needs, 
          which has so far exceeded my expectations! 
          </li>

          <ul><h3 class="ol-blog-3">
            7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to 
            plan these in.  
          </h3></ul>
     <li class="li-blog-3">
      During foundations I am working from 8am-12:30pm weekdays except for Wednesdays 
      when I work 8-10:30am so I can make the 11am homegroup meeting.  
      I try to keep my afternoons and weekends available for DEV work, 
      but sometimes I will need to babysit or help my sister with other 
      life-stuff. <br> <br> The week between foundations and bootcamp I am moving from Palmerston North to Tāmaki Makaurau. 
      So that week will be mostly getting my new home situation set up, but 
      maybe I’ll have some time for catching up on foundation work (hopefully I’m 
      ahead of the game / on task at that point, but you never know.)
