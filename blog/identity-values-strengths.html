      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">Example situation where I made an ethical decision. <br>
        How I weighed up the the values involved in that decision, the decision I made, 
        and how I reflect on the decision now.
      </h3></ul>
          <li class="li-blog-2">When Covid first hit in early 2020, I was in the middle of my last year of a post-graduate degree in the Netherlands. 
            At that point, everything changed. I won't get into specifics, but essentially our course was 
            delayed by about a year. At that time, I couldn't find any decent work and I was very isolated (like most 
            people) during those first lockdowns. My mental health was also in a bad state. <br>
            In late 2020, my sister found out she was pregnant. Which made me decide to move back to Aotearoa New Zealand. 
            My guiding values at that time were simple; I wanted her to be supported during her pregnancy/ early baby days and have people around.  
            And I also realised that it would be easier for me to find work in Aotearoa, due to less Covid restrictions and less of a language barrier. 
            Although it was expensive, I reflect on this decision really fondly, and think it was the right choice to move to Palmerston North to be closer 
            to her and Charlie for the last year. I've really treasured this time.</li>
            
<ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">How my culture and the people around you have influenced my values and identity.</h3> 
      </ul>
          <li class="li-blog-2">I grew up in the Netherlands until I was 8 years old. In 2000 my 
            immediate family; mum, dad, 2x siblings, immigrated to Aotearoa NZ. As middle class immigrants, we worked hard to adjust to the new context, culture and language. 
            The name of the game from the get go was assimilate as quickly as possible. 
            We only spoke english at home from that point. <br> 
            As a shy kid, my mother recognised 
            my interest in art and music, and encouraged this. These interests and validation from 
            others gave me confidence in my abilities and helped me to realise that I could 
            communicate and connect with others through artistic means. 
            <br> 
            As a family, our over-arching shared value is a kind of resilient work-ethic and the 
            importance of having a sense of humour to cope with life. Two things that have both hindered and helped me 
            with work and life.  
            <br> Through the arts, I’ve met dear friends and collaborators who have influenced 
            the way I think about myself, my work and the complexity of the world at large. I was lucky enough 
            to participate in an international post-graduate program, where I worked with 
            people from many different kinds of backgrounds and value systems, this really helped me hone 
            a day-to-day sense of empathy and respect for others. 
            <br> 
            My personal ongoing journey over the last few years has centred around struggles with mental health and exploring my own 
            identity in ways I had repressed for a long time. 
            This has involved the support of professionals, friends, and some family. 
            I feel seen and supported by (mostly my queer and trans) community who bolster 
            my self-worth and sense of belonging, and my sister is a huge support for building up my 
            general resilience and motivation to pursue my general life goals.

            <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">My strengths and how they will support me during my learning journey.</h3> 
            </ul>
                <li class="li-blog-2">
                  I struggled to answer this, because self-deprecation is one of my crutches. 
                  But I asked some dear friends and they helped me to recognise certain strengths.  

                  One bestie in particular listed the following: creativity, enthusiasm, warmth, problem-solving, organisation, 
                  recognising other people’s strengths, making people feel included. 

                  I think my warmth and commitment to making others feel welcome in a learning environment 
                  stems from my experience as a tutor, student, volunteer program manager and group therapy participant. 
                  I believe this ability for creating an inclusive environment will serve me well in this DEV learning journey. 
                  As I know it can be hard to learn when one feels alienated. 
                    <br> <br>
                  Creativity - This tendency is closely connected with my motivation to solve problems (big, small and ridiculous). 
                  This will help me at DEV because I will approach problems with an unassuming curiosity and try different ways 
                  of finding solutions on my own before seeking help straight away. 
                  <br> <br>
                  Organised / Responsible. I’m a fan of scheduling, time tables, lists, calendar (digital and paper) which will
                  be crucial for managing the foundation workload while working part time, but will serve me well at bootcamp too. 
                  This way of living is very familiar to me as someone who has had to juggle multiple jobs and responsibilities at once. 
                  And it is a coping mechanism that helps me feel more at ease with new experiences.
                  <br> <br>
                  I take a lot of responsibility and pride in myself and my work. 
                  And I apply the same level of dedication to my relationships with others. for example,
                  I take friendships, family, and collaborative working relationships very seriously. 
                  I consider myself a trustworthy and dependable person. Sometimes I help others a little too much, 
                  but I am continuing to practise setting realistic boundaries and expectations, however awkward it might feel. 
<br> <br> 
                  I’m good at advocating for others and recognising their strengths. 
                  I genuinly love to bolster and strengthen other people's abilities and confidence where I can.

        <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">Evaluation of my limitations in terms of my learning and career development. 
          <br>How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3></ul>
            <li class="li-blog-2">
              I really love to work with others, but I’m also aware that I have spent a lot of time 
              working independently. So I have to keep my urge to be involved in every part of a project in check. 
              <br>
             To do this I regularly remind myself that people have different interests, motivations, and feelings about something, 
              and I need to leave space for that in all collaborative settings. 
              <br> I can also get impatient and frustrated when 
              other people are disorganised or unreliable. <br> <br> 
              I can also be a bit of a people pleaser, probably a hangover from the “assimilate as quickly as possible 
              to the anglo-cis-hetero-environment around you” thing. And it’s also a fast way of connecting with others. 
              But the flip side of this tendency is that I sometimes struggle to communicate my own views 
              or ideas if they are too different to the group. This also feeds into my imposter syndrome and hyper-vigilant habit of rehearsing 
              social interactions, so sometimes direct face-to-face expression can be hard if I'm not in a good headspace. 
              I am aware of this though, and if there’s anything I feel I need to communicate but struggle to 
              do it in the moment verbally, I will find another way to make sure I'm heard. 
              </li>

                An example of when I was trying to work productively with others,
                but there was resistance or tension. <br> Some specific strategies that I tried at the time, 
                how effective they were, and what other strategies I would try now and why.
              </h3></ul>
                  <li class="li-blog-2">
                    I’ve been working a lot with a friend and collaborator from Glasgow, which can be 
                    tough due to time zones. Sometimes there will be communication breakdowns, 
                    especially because we think quite differently and remember discussions, 
                    or information differently. For example, working with shared folders and file 
                    sharing through google drive and Adobe was a constant source of frustration. 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    One time when we were zooming, I decided that we could come up with a more 
                    effective and user friendly system of organising and storing shared files. 
                    I listened to what they found to be a logical storing system, 
                    compared it to my approach, and thought about what I could change and be more 
                    flexible on. We then merged those two approaches live on the zoom call with a shared screen, so that we would have
                   less frustrations in the future. This felt like a good approach, because this outcome ensured we were both heard and recognised. 
                    I find this diplomatic strategy is usually a helpful way to mitigate most 
                    disagreements and conflicts.
