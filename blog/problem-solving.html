          <ul class="h2-blog1">When I was blocked on a simple problem:</ul>
            <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ What was the problem?</ul>
              <p class="p-text"> 
                
                I was struggling with adding a score to the student’s testScores in Gradebook. 
              
              </p>
              <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ What problem-solving techniques did you use??</ul>
              <p class="p-text">
                
                I tried various different methods and approaches, I usually start a problem by jumping straight in with some random idea and swapping out miscellaneous variables.
              
              </p>
              <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ How did you feel throughout the process?</ul>
              <p class="p-text"> I started out feeling pretty confident, like oh yeah, I know what method to use EASY. But then that wasn’t working, and I couldn’t understand why. I had a feeling it had something to do with the syntax, and how I was referring to the parameters in the function itself, but I didn’t know how to fix it, and was getting pretty overwhelmed with self-doubt. 
                <br> <br> 
                Then I asked the homegroup for help, because I saw that Aliyah was stuck at the same place as me. It was nice to feel like even though we were stuck in different ways, we could maybe solve it together. With the guidance of Johnny and Aliyah, I was able to learn that it was in fact the way I was using the [ ] , and how to call different parameters inside the function. Once I fixed that, it was clear that my logic wasn’t actually flawed. Which was reassuring. Johnny was really helpful in recognising that the self-doubt wasn’t helpful.  
                </p>
                <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ What did you learn?</ul>
                <li class="p-text-list">Listening and learning from feedback is very helpful.</li>
                <li class="p-text-list"> Seeking out the kind of explanations that make sense to me at my current stage of learning, and not feeling guilty about that. Right now I’m still learning the best by watching video demonstrations. Probably because I'm a audio/visual learner. The docs and text explanations don’t really stick in my head, but in saying that, they are slowly becoming less mysterious to read… </li>
                <li class="p-text-list"> Learning to trust my intuition more! Don’t scrap an idea immediately. If the basic idea makes sense, keep developing it until it works. Don’t let DOUBT override this early process. </li>
                <li class="p-text-list">Learning to let go. I can’t force a solution to happen just because I want it to. If something is completely befuddling me, I have started taking a step back, either taking a break, or looking into another type of problem. To take my mind off it. A fresh pair of eyes works wonders at giving perspective. I have a tendency to get sucked into stuff, which can be good because I’ll stick to something and see it through, but it can also be very counter-productive because I lose sight of what’s actually useful.  </li>
                <li class="p-text-list">Started to use the pseudocode technique more which is a good way to anchor the process and break the problem down into more do-able sections.  Like a pizza, it’s hard to eat as a whole, but more do-able when you cut it into slices.

        <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ What problem-solving techniques did you use?</ul>
        <p class="p-text"> 

          I actually trusted my gut ideas and pulled from some techniques / methods from previous tasks. In particular, I utilized two new techniques that Jared showed me with the reduce method, where we returned an array that reduced the old array to only every second item. I re-configured this idea to reduce an array to only give back the even numbers. I thought this might work, and I stuck to it, using my specialty, “try and test a thousand variations until something works” to ultimately pass the test. The other technique I pulled from was using this really cool trick, which I forgot the real name for, but I like to call  <span> the dramatic pause </span>  Which uses “<span> . . . </span>” to copy the contents of an object into a new object, and lets you change the properties and add extras. Very handy... 
        
        </p>
        <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ How did you feel throughout the process?</ul>
        <p class="p-text"> I felt like a badass haha. It made me very aware of how this new information/ knowledge actually digests within my system. I have an anxiety about my memory and logic. So the JS Olympics were reassuring in that I could trust myself and actually trust my <span> gut </span> instincts without completely abandoning them at the first sign of trouble. 
        </p>

        <ul class="sub-heading"> ~ What did you learn? </ul>
        <p class="p-text"> I learnt that the neurotransmitters in my gut are probably more trustworthy than my mind. I also learnt that I can use pseudocode to break a problem down into smaller pieces, in the same way I would slice a <span> pizza </span> to eat it. </p>
