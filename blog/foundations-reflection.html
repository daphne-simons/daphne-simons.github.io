      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-2">That I'm a lot more determined and self-motivated than I thought. 
      </li>
      <li class="li-blog-2">That my patience does have limits and I can get pretty frustrated.  
      </li>
      <li class="li-blog-2">
        That it doesn’t take much for me to feel stupid. 
      </li>

    <div class="border-1"> 
      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-2">I believe that the role of empathy in learning and programming is crucial because it allows you to gauge the feelings and needs of yourself and others in any learning and professional context. Acknowledging that you’re a complex human amongst other complex humans is a useful thing to know in most situations. I see values as forms of social wishes, for me they are the most hopeful parts of myself that I try to evoke in my interactions with others.   
      </li>
    </div>
    <div class="border-4"> 
        <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">What has surprised you the most about the core curriculum? </h3></ul>
        <li class="li-blog-2"> I thought I would be more cynical about it than I have been. I got very into the core content and really see the worth of it based on my previous life and work experiences. It also made me realise that I should give myself some more credit, because a lot of the techniques / attitudes it introduced; i.e. growth mindset, independent problem solving techniques, I have been developing and using in various ways over the years already without articulating them. So it was also a bit of a process in recognising the strengths I already have, and continuing to build on those. 
        </li>
      </div>

    <div class="border-1"> 
      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-2">Honestly, sticking to my 2x daily mindfulness practice. I have dropped the ball on that a bit while juggling work and moving cities during the foundations course. I really value self care so I feel guilty about not committing to that as much as I'd planned to. </li>
    </div>

    <div class="border-4"> 
      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-2"> Because it helps you to learn and work better. Not just for yourself and your own abilities, but also your ability to work well with others. It’s about maintaining realistic expectations of yourself and others, and learning more about the ways that you might operate within a team in an actual professional environment. </li>
    </div>

    <div class="border-1"> 
      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3></ul>
      <li class="li-blog-2">No!!! It anchored things for me. If it was just cramming coding repetitions in my head all the time it would feel so hermetic and alienating! It’s been a great way to ground me, as someone coming into this field totally fresh, it’s been a helpful way to acknowledge where I’m coming from, what is driving me, and what doing this actually means for my life in general. So no, a holistic perspective has not felt like a waste of time for me, if anything it’s made me more motivated. </li>
