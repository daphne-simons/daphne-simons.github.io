      <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">What is emotional intelligence? 
      </h3></ul>
          <li class="li-blog-2">To me, emotional intelligence is the ability to gauge and discern the emotions 
            or motivations of ourselves and others and to consciously act according to this sense of shared entanglement 
            that comes from being, living and working with others. 
          </li>

          <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">How is it different to IQ?
          </h3></ul>
              <li class="li-blog-2">
                Emotional intelligence is often overlooked in favour of IQ. 

                But what is an IQ standard? To me, it is closely connected to the standards and the rational subjects 
                prevalent in eurocentric education systems (math, science, technology).<br> The topics that are tested and measured 
                through the IQ lens focus on someones speed of logic, analytical thought, and speed of perception. 
                <br> IQ numbers compare someone’s test results against other people's test results of a similar age bracket to 
                see how they stack up in relation to the group.  <br> 
                IQ tests have been historically used to advance unethical pseudo-scientific projects such as eugenics 
                and can often be discriminating. For example, they champion one neurological type above others and their results are effected 
                by class, education and cultural backgrounds. <br> 
                I find it important to question “who sets the IQ standard and who is benefitting from its results?” <br><br>
                
                EQ is a more nuanced proposition that attempts to measure someone’s ability to relate to oneself and others. 
                It has more affective and nuanced parameters and seems rooted in social communication. 
                It looks at the many verbal and non-verbal strategies that people use to function in a variety of social situations, 
                both comfortable and uncomfortable. <br> <br> 
               EQ prioritises things like introspection, empathy and ones ability to regulate and manage emotional and 
                behavioural responses. This type of self-reflexivity and sensitivity to the needs of others are things that 
                historically haven't been considered valuable enough to serve the rational patriarchal system unless 
                they were channelled through art, writing or enforced gender roles. 

                <ul><h3 class="ul-blog-2">Why is it important?
                </h3></ul>
                    <li class="li-blog-2">
                      EQ is vital for all aspects of life because we are social beings that thrive and struggle in company with others. 
                      The more that people try and learn EQ techniques, the more manageable the peaks and valley's of this 
                      lil ol' thing called life can be. <br> EQ is also fundamental in work and study environments, 
                      because you’re working in constant communication with other humans who all have unique personalities, 
                      beliefs, backgrounds, identities and motivations. 
                      When you’re able to empathise with others and actively navigate your interactions accordingly it 
                      can make them smoother and more fullfilling. <br> <br> I believe it’s an ongoing and 
                      inevitably messy skill to practise, but it seems worth the effort unless you want to live in solitude on a desolate planet, 
                      which may be your jam.
